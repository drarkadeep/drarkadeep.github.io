                <p>
                    As you might have guessed from the website url (arkadeep.com), the heading above ("Hi, Arkadeep
                    here"),
                    the title of this page ("Arkadeep.com by Arkadeep Mukhopadhyay") and the non-zero probability that
                    it
                    was me (Arkadeep Mukhopadhyay) who had shared the link of this website with you that my name is,
                    indeed,
                    Arkadeep Mukhopadhyay.

                </div>
                <p>
                    I'm delighted to have you here. I would love to give you a freshly baked chocolate cookie, right
                    now. But, the absense of freshly baked cookies in my vicinity and the constrained food teleportation
                    abilities of the 21st century internet is significantly deterring such an effort from my end. And
                    that's
                    why, this website uses no cookies and will never track your activities, show ads or compromise with
                    your
                    privacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that being said, there remains no way for me to know who you are. This letter is a mode of
                    one-way
                    communication and the mic is in my hands with me showing no signs of giving it away. Therefore,
                    there's
                    only one thing that we can do. We can brainstorm the possibilities...
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You can be family. In that case, let us continue this conversation over phone, FaceTime or
                        WhatsApp.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can be a friend. Then you would be the target demographic for a cheeky letter such as this.
                        You
                        can continue reading this letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can be my teacher, mentor, professor, guide or senior. It makes me very happy that you're
                        visiting my website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can be an acquaintance. You may not know me well. Then again, that's exactly what this
                        website
                        is for. I too would like to know more about you. And once we both learn enough about each other,
                        I'm
                        sure your case shall merge with one of the two preceding possibilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can be a kind internet stranger. Well, I wouldn't call you that anymore, you're an
                        acquaintance
                        now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can be me. I'm not joking, I literally visit my own site from various browsers and devices
                        to
                        evaluate my site's performance. If you're indeed me, I would like to end this soliloquy right
                        now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, you can be a bot scraping my meticulously hand-written content to feed LLMs and train
                        chatbots. That means you must have ignored my <a href="robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file. Not
                        cool.
                        (BTW, if you're the google
                        crawler - <a href="sitemap.xml">here's my sitemap</a>, feel free to index my site and boost my
                        PageRank.)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Now that you're here, I would not mind showing you around. The projects I worked on are listed <a
                        href="/projects" rel="follow">here</a>. You can find some old Antarctica Daily articles <a
                        href="/arkive" rel="follow">here</a> (and some new ones <a href="/intbtngcl"
                        rel="nofollow">here</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to keep writing this letter. Later. For now, I shall take a break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peace.

        <section class="big-heading" id="violet">
            <h1 class="title">Just a very big heading!</h1>
            <h4 class="subtitle">
                Existence of this section is more philosophical than practical.
            </h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Recently I read an article on 'The Bitter Southerner' which had a beautiful serif heading
                    spanning
                    the entire width of the laptop screen. Now on my site, I restrict most of the content to a width of
                    about 840px to conserve readable character count per line. But the grand wide title made me want
                    to
                    have one for my site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then much akin to Bilbo, I thought, "After all, Why not? Why shouldn't I 'have' it?". And thus I
                    set forth to build this section of the site, as a reminder to my future self about the
                    freedom of having one's own website. So often, while following the best practices for the web
                    and optimising load times for throttled networks, this elusive freedom, though obvious in moments
                    of such <i>Bilboid</i> revelations, simply percolates away from the foresight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, the reality remains that this section serves no meaninful purpose, shares no useful fact
                    and does no important job. Not a single soul shall be troubled sans this section. All it is, is
                    a big heading, that renders screen wide when viewed on a screen wide enough!
                </p>

            <h1 class="title">Rethinking my Blog</h1>
            <h4 class="subtitle">
                I'm trying to be unique, just like everybody else
            </h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    I think, I have been rethinking the way I blog for quite some time. I finally think, I have rethunk enough. Here's my rethought thought...
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I blog, I do so in episodes. Each post during that episode, tends to share a common narrative. It takes a handful of posts to substantially communicate the entire narrative beyond which my will to continue narrating asymptotically diminishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Till today, my go to method was to either create a new blog or a new tag/cetegory in an existing blog when I wanted to share a new narrative. But why not create an episode, the natural, structural and functional unit of my "bloggular" communication? Precisely that, my friend, is the kind of blog that all this rethinking has yielded. 
                </p>

                Horrible <i>horrible</i> projects that I work on (but it's fun)
            </h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Agraham Paulincoln once said, "Open Source is for the people, of the people, by the people" (probably). Inspired by that I decided, I should openly publish the stuff I create in my free time directly onto my Github. Now this had 2 benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One, my Github account was lying barren lately as I couldn't really figure out what should I put up there. Most of the code I write are for personal stuff and bizarre projects made for fun. But with a little brushing up, these can be both entertaining and useful for others and if there's something you'd rather change, you can simply clone, fork or send pull requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two, till today I used to host them sporadically via a bunch of static site servers like surge, firebase and at times, even ngroked them right out of my PC. Upkeeping these projects was painful. So, having them all on Github would be stonks.

                    When every tech giant is spinning out their Latest Large Language Model, you can no longer "win the world" by saying a lot. Now you have to say less. But say valuable things.

                <p>
                    And that's where PeePeeTea comes in. It just enables you to share only what's necessary. Short and Crisp.
